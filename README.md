# Discord Quiz Bot

This is a bot that asks users trivia questions and keeps track of their scores. The questions are loaded from a `questions.json` file, and user data is stored in a `user_data.json` file. This bot was possibly made for CTF (Capture The Flag) stuff in the future.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/AIMadeScripts/discordbotquiz.git`
2. cd `discordbotquiz`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Make sure to edit the very last line bot.run('TOKEN_GOES_HERE')  
5. Run the bot: `python questions.py`


## Usage

The bot has several commands:

- `!ask` - asks the user a new question
- `!answer <user_answer>` - checks the user's answer and updates their score
- `!current` - tells the user their current question
- `!points` - tells the user their current score
- `!reset` - resets the user's score and progress
- `!leaderboard` - displays the current leaderboard
