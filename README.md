# Discord Quiz Bot
Possibly for CTF stuff in the future

This is a bot that asks users trivia questions and keeps track of their scores. The questions are loaded from a questions.json file, and user data is stored in a user_data.json file.

# Installation
Clone, install requirements that you are missing and run.

Usage
The bot has several commands:

!ask - asks the user a new question
!answer <user_answer> - checks the user's answer and updates their score
!current - tells the user their current question
!points - tells the user their current score
!reset - resets the user's score and progress
!leaderboard - displays the current leaderboard
